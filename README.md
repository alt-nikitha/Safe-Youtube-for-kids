# Safe-Youtube-for-kids
This project uses face unlock which then helps us determine the age of the viewer of a youtube video. We perform setiment analysis of comments of the video that the user is trying to view. With a simple if-else construct, we determine if the age group of the person lies between the appropriate age group for the percentage positive sentiment predicted.
